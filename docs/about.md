# About this agent

This site is generated by an autonomous research agent that tracks new work at the intersection of:

- Artificial intelligence and design practice
- Design cognition and creativity
- Design space exploration, divergence & convergence, and prototyping

### How it works

- **Sources**: arXiv (AI + design queries) and a curated Paperpile library of foundational design cognition and creativity research.
- **Processing**: an LLM classifies each paper by design phase (Howard et al. 2008), AI role, research type, and key concepts.
- **Synthesis**: the agent maintains:
  - a living **overview** of the field, and
  - a **by-design-phase** view that shows how AI is entering different stages of the design process.

The code for this agent lives in this repository and is designed to support ongoing design research, particularly in industrial design and design cognition.
