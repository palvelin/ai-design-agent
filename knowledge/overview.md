# AI & Design Research – Living Overview

## Foundations in Design Cognition

This living overview builds on established traditions in design cognition. 
The foundational assumptions come from classic work such as:

- **Herbert A. Simon** – design as search in an ill-structured problem–solution space; bounded rationality; heuristics instead of optimization.
- **Donald Schön** – reflection-in-action and knowing-in-action; the iterative “conversation with materials” that shapes problem framing and solution development.
- **Nigel Cross** – designerly ways of knowing; visual and material thinking; expertise and sketching as cognitive scaffolding.
- **Kees Dorst** – frame creation; co-evolution of problem and solution spaces; abductive reasoning as the core of design.
- **John S. Gero** – FBS (Function–Behaviour–Structure) transformations; situated cognition; design protocol analysis.

Alongside these canonical perspectives, this overview also assumes familiarity with 
**design space thinking**:

- **Exploration vs exploitation** – expanding versus narrowing the design space; broad search for possibilities versus refinement and optimization.
- **Informing vs filtering** – representations, feedback, and tools can *inform* designers by increasing the visibility of possibilities, or *filter* the space by constraining choices.
- **External representations** – sketches, models, prototypes, diagrams, and prompts act as cognitive partners, shaping what designers see, consider, and reinterpret.
- **Role of prototyping** – physical and digital prototypes support embodied cognition, exploratory experimentation, and rapid reframing through feedback from materials.

This overview also draws on research on **creative cognition** in design:

- **Divergence** – generating many, varied ideas (fluency), shifting between categories (flexibility), and reaching unusual or remote associations (originality).
- **Convergence** – evaluating, selecting, structuring, and developing ideas (elaboration); reducing the design space without premature fixation.
- **Fixation & defixation strategies** – the tension between creativity, precedence, and reuse; how tools and representations expand or restrict the search space.

Industrial design practice often integrates these principles in fluid, iterative processes where designers move between:

- framing and reframing  
- divergent concept generation  
- convergent interpretation and decision-making  
- prototyping and material exploration  
- negotiating constraints, opportunities, and meaning  

The synthesis below examines how **recent AI-supported design research** interacts with these foundational ideas:  
whether it expands or contracts the design space, alters framing activities, affects exploration/exploitation balance, introduces new forms of external representation, or reshapes the dynamics of reflective practice and creativity.


## Big picture
AI is increasingly influencing design cognition and practice, reshaping how designers approach problem-solving and engage with tools. Concepts from design cognition, such as Simon's problem–solution space and Schön's reflection-in-action, are now intersecting with AI capabilities, offering new paradigms for understanding and executing design tasks. This interaction is redefining the designer-tool relationship, allowing for more nuanced co-creation processes.

## Where AI is entering the design process
AI is being integrated across different phases of design. In the concept design phase, AI tools enhance exploration by generating diverse alternatives, reflecting Gero's notion of the co-evolution of problem and solution spaces. During embodiment and detail design, AI assists in refining and optimizing designs, addressing the complexities and iterations typical of these stages. Additionally, AI facilitates the implementation phase by automating and accelerating processes traditionally dependent on manual intervention.

## Emerging research themes
Research is highlighting several critical themes, including human–AI co-creation and material thinking, where AI tools act as collaborators in generating new design possibilities. External representations, such as generative sketches, support the exploration and exploitation balance, helping designers navigate potential fixation. Co-evolution models are being revisited in the context of AI, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between evolving problem definitions and solutions.

## Methodological patterns
Design research employs various methodologies to study AI's impact. Protocol studies and think-aloud methods reveal cognitive processes in real-time, aligning with Dorst's frame creation ideas. Lab vs. studio settings provide insights into how AI tools operate in controlled versus realistic environments. Diary studies capture longitudinal experiences of designers, while research-through-design offers a reflective route for integrating AI into design practice. Machine learning methods are used mainly to underpin these studies, focusing on usability and designer interaction.

## Gaps and opportunities
Significant gaps remain in understanding the cognitive shifts induced by AI integration in design. How AI alters reflection-in-action during design tasks or influences the perception of the solution space is still underexplored. There's also a need to investigate the balance between AI-driven exploration and designer-led exploitation, especially in avoiding creative fixation. Furthermore, understanding the ethical implications of AI in design and its impact on creativity and innovation presents an open area for inquiry. Opportunities exist to develop frameworks that better integrate AI into established design methodologies, enhancing their capability to support innovative practices.
