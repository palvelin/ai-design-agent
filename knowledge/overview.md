# AI & Design Research – Living Overview

## Foundations in Design Cognition

This living overview builds on established traditions in design cognition. 
The foundational assumptions come from classic work such as:

- **Herbert A. Simon** – design as search in an ill-structured problem–solution space; bounded rationality; heuristics instead of optimization.
- **Donald Schön** – reflection-in-action and knowing-in-action; the iterative “conversation with materials” that shapes problem framing and solution development.
- **Nigel Cross** – designerly ways of knowing; visual and material thinking; expertise and sketching as cognitive scaffolding.
- **Kees Dorst** – frame creation; co-evolution of problem and solution spaces; abductive reasoning as the core of design.
- **John S. Gero** – FBS (Function–Behaviour–Structure) transformations; situated cognition; design protocol analysis.

Alongside these canonical perspectives, this overview also assumes familiarity with 
**design space thinking**:

- **Exploration vs exploitation** – expanding versus narrowing the design space; broad search for possibilities versus refinement and optimization.
- **Informing vs filtering** – representations, feedback, and tools can *inform* designers by increasing the visibility of possibilities, or *filter* the space by constraining choices.
- **External representations** – sketches, models, prototypes, diagrams, and prompts act as cognitive partners, shaping what designers see, consider, and reinterpret.
- **Role of prototyping** – physical and digital prototypes support embodied cognition, exploratory experimentation, and rapid reframing through feedback from materials.

This overview also draws on research on **creative cognition** in design:

- **Divergence** – generating many, varied ideas (fluency), shifting between categories (flexibility), and reaching unusual or remote associations (originality).
- **Convergence** – evaluating, selecting, structuring, and developing ideas (elaboration); reducing the design space without premature fixation.
- **Fixation & defixation strategies** – the tension between creativity, precedence, and reuse; how tools and representations expand or restrict the search space.

Industrial design practice often integrates these principles in fluid, iterative processes where designers move between:

- framing and reframing  
- divergent concept generation  
- convergent interpretation and decision-making  
- prototyping and material exploration  
- negotiating constraints, opportunities, and meaning  

The synthesis below examines how **recent AI-supported design research** interacts with these foundational ideas:  
whether it expands or contracts the design space, alters framing activities, affects exploration/exploitation balance, introduces new forms of external representation, or reshapes the dynamics of reflective practice and creativity.


## Big Picture

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is redefining the landscape of design cognition and practice. It offers new possibilities for how problems and solutions are framed, explored, and realized, extending our understanding of traditional design cognition theories from key figures like Simon, Schön, Dorst, and Gero. This overview explores how AI enhances design cognition, affects design processes, and reshapes the dynamic between designers and their tools, moving beyond the mechanics of algorithms to the insights they enable in design contexts.

## Where AI is Entering the Design Process

AI is integrating into various phases of the design process, creating new roles for itself as a collaborator, facilitator, and enhancer of creativity. During the early stages, AI aids in conceptual design—generating diverse ideas and stimulating frame creation as per Dorst's theories. As the process progresses, AI contributes to exploration and refinement, aligning with Gero's Function-Behaviour-Structure (FBS) model, by providing computational power to evaluate a vast array of alternatives. Moreover, during implementation, AI systems optimize designs based on real-world constraints, automating repetitive tasks, and enabling designers to engage in Schön's reflection-in-action more effectively.

## Emerging Research Themes

Several key themes are emerging where AI intertwines with design cognition:

- **External Representations**: AI systems provide dynamic and rich external representations that aid designers in visualizing and manipulating complex data.
- **Co-evolution**: AI facilitates co-evolution of problem and solution spaces, a fundamental aspect outlined by Simon.
- **Fixation and Exploration vs. Exploitation**: AI helps mitigate design fixation by suggesting novel, often non-intuitive solutions, supporting a balance between exploration of new ideas and exploitation of known ones.
- **Human–AI Co-Creation**: AI systems act as co-creators, offering new potential for narrative and material thinking, enhancing the dialogue between human and machine creativity.

## Methodological Patterns

Research into AI’s impact on design employs a mix of traditional and innovative methods:

- **Protocol Studies**: These help dissect the cognitive processes of designers using AI tools, drawing insights from Gero's design protocols.
- **Lab vs. Studio Settings**: Experiments range from controlled lab studies to more naturalistic studio environments, examining how AI tools influence creative processes.
- **Think-Aloud and Diary Studies**: These methods capture the reflective practices of designers, resonating with Schön’s reflective practice theories.
- **Research-through-Design**: AI-driven tools become vehicles for speculative design studies, pushing boundaries of what design can achieve.
- While machine learning methods are mostly used behind the scenes, their influence on cognitive processes becomes a subject of interest in such studies.

## Gaps and Opportunities

Despite advancements, there remain significant gaps in our understanding of AI's role in design cognition and practice:

- **Designers’ Thinking Patterns**: Little is known about how designers internalize and integrate AI-generated suggestions into their workflows.
- **Long-term Impact**: The long-term effects of dependence on AI tools for creativity and problem-solving remain underexplored.
- **Ethical Considerations**: How ethical considerations influence AI-driven design processes, especially in high-stakes industries, needs deeper investigation.
- **Tool Transparency and Interpretability**: Ensuring AI systems are transparent and interpretable to designers is crucial for fostering trust and effective use.

These gaps highlight opportunities for further research that could advance our understanding of the dynamic interplay between human designers and AI systems in creating innovative, thoughtful, and effective design solutions.
