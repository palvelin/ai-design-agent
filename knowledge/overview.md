# AI & Design Research – Living Overview

## Foundations in Design Cognition

This living overview builds on established traditions in design cognition. 
The foundational assumptions come from classic work such as:

- **Herbert A. Simon** – design as search in an ill-structured problem–solution space; bounded rationality; heuristics instead of optimization.
- **Donald Schön** – reflection-in-action and knowing-in-action; the iterative “conversation with materials” that shapes problem framing and solution development.
- **Nigel Cross** – designerly ways of knowing; visual and material thinking; expertise and sketching as cognitive scaffolding.
- **Kees Dorst** – frame creation; co-evolution of problem and solution spaces; abductive reasoning as the core of design.
- **John S. Gero** – FBS (Function–Behaviour–Structure) transformations; situated cognition; design protocol analysis.

Alongside these canonical perspectives, this overview also assumes familiarity with 
**design space thinking**:

- **Exploration vs exploitation** – expanding versus narrowing the design space; broad search for possibilities versus refinement and optimization.
- **Informing vs filtering** – representations, feedback, and tools can *inform* designers by increasing the visibility of possibilities, or *filter* the space by constraining choices.
- **External representations** – sketches, models, prototypes, diagrams, and prompts act as cognitive partners, shaping what designers see, consider, and reinterpret.
- **Role of prototyping** – physical and digital prototypes support embodied cognition, exploratory experimentation, and rapid reframing through feedback from materials.

This overview also draws on research on **creative cognition** in design:

- **Divergence** – generating many, varied ideas (fluency), shifting between categories (flexibility), and reaching unusual or remote associations (originality).
- **Convergence** – evaluating, selecting, structuring, and developing ideas (elaboration); reducing the design space without premature fixation.
- **Fixation & defixation strategies** – the tension between creativity, precedence, and reuse; how tools and representations expand or restrict the search space.

Industrial design practice often integrates these principles in fluid, iterative processes where designers move between:

- framing and reframing  
- divergent concept generation  
- convergent interpretation and decision-making  
- prototyping and material exploration  
- negotiating constraints, opportunities, and meaning  

The synthesis below examines how **recent AI-supported design research** interacts with these foundational ideas:  
whether it expands or contracts the design space, alters framing activities, affects exploration/exploitation balance, introduces new forms of external representation, or reshapes the dynamics of reflective practice and creativity.


## Big picture

Recent AI research is profoundly influencing how designers think, act, and relate to their tools. Rather than focusing on AI algorithms per se, the emerging landscape reveals shifts in design cognition, exploration strategies, and material engagement. AI systems now operate as active collaborators within design processes, reshaping the situated, reflective practice described by Schön and expanding the notion of frame creation articulated by Dorst. Simon’s classic conception of problem and solution spaces is reframed as AI tools provide new ways to traverse, augment, or even co-evolve these spaces. These transitions invite design researchers to rethink the cognitive work of framing, exploring, fixing, and embodying designs when AI’s generative and analytical capacities are integrated.

## Where AI is entering the design process

AI engagement is evident across several design phases, emphasizing a designer-centred experience.

- **Establishing a need & analysis of task:** AI systems help identify gaps, generate domain insights, or reveal biases (e.g., diverse face image datasets combating bias, or geopolitical perspectives on AI governance). Here AI functions as an external analytic partner supporting the framing of design problems and identifying user or societal challenges.

- **Concept design & frame creation:** Generative AI technologies assist in exploring and expanding the conceptual space. Tools like text-to-3D environment systems (WorldGen) exemplify AI’s role in rapidly materializing abstract ideas into tangible visual and spatial frames. The human designer acts as a reflective agent working with AI to co-create and redefine frames, sometimes intervening iteratively on generative outputs (reflection-in-action).

- **Embodiment and detail design:** AI supports the refinement and incremental editing of physical form (Mesh RAG for 3D mesh generation) or design details such as lens aberration correction or peptide optimization, enabling rapid iteration. Here, AI encodes domain knowledge and material constraints, shaping design representations and coupling tightly with designer judgment.

- **Implementation & system design:** AI transitions from generative to operational roles, supporting deployment, control, or interactive system tuning (e.g., motion prediction in assistive robots, multi-agent navigation). Designers collaborate with AI not only to create but also to validate, monitor, and evolve systems in situ.

- **Evaluation and reliability:** Benchmarking frameworks (e.g., GPU reliability in enterprise UI agents or robustness against sycophancy in language models) mark an important phase where designers assess AI’s trustworthiness and operational consistency, tying back to practical deployment and human factors considerations.

## Emerging research themes

- **External representations and co-evolution:** Many studies emphasize AI-augmented external representations — 3D models, visual datasets, sketches guiding physical simulation — that mediate human-AI interaction. This aligns with Gero’s FBS model by revealing how AI influences function, behaviour, and structure representations, co-evolving with designer input.

- **Fixation and exploration balance:** AI’s assistance both mitigates design fixation by proposing novel variations and risks reinforcing existing frames through overreliance on learned patterns. Studies on creative gaps between human and AI visual generation highlight the persistence of this tension, reflecting Simon’s solution space navigation challenges.

- **Human–AI co-creation and reflection-in-action:** AI tools serve as reflective agents that surface latent problems or suggest alternatives, prompting designers’ reflective moves. This dialogue reinforces design as a dynamic conversation, with AI transforming from a passive tool to an active participant in Schön’s reflection-in-action.

- **Material thinking and embodiment:** Frameworks like Mesh RAG or physics-aware video generation show AI's role in negotiating material constraints and dynamic behaviour, expanding designer cognition into embodiment concerns. AI augments not only abstract ideation but also the tangible negotiation with material realities and physical laws.

- **Ethics, bias, and social context:** AI-generated data diversity and geopolitical AI governance underscore that design cognition extends into ethical and collective dimensions, requiring designers to navigate not just technical but also societal frames.

## Methodological patterns

- **Protocol and diary studies vs. lab-studio dichotomy:** While many studies are situated in controlled lab environments (benchmarking AI models or running quantitative performance tests), others embrace research-through-design and studio-based prototyping (mixed reality heritage streaming, sketch-guided physical simulations). The interplay reveals a methodological spectrum reflecting the dual challenges of rigorous evaluation and ecological validity.

- **Think-aloud and interaction logging:** Investigations into human-AI collaboration often rely on think-aloud methods or interaction trace logging, capturing designer cognitive strategies and decision points when working with AI-generated artifacts or recommendations.

- **Research-through-design and enactment:** Several works embody concepts through system or prototype build (e.g., peptide optimization frameworks, assistive robotics), allowing reflective critique and the surfacing of emergent cognitive patterns in situated practice.

- **Selective use of ML methods:** Machine learning techniques underpin many systems but are described in researcher-usable terms (e.g., retrieval augmentation, transformer architectures) without delving into algorithmic minutiae. This respects the focus on design cognition and practice rather than AI mechanics.

## Gaps and opportunities

- **Understanding designer-AI framing dynamics:** While AI augments frame creation and redefinition, more empirical insight is needed into how designers negotiate, trust, or resist AI framings in situ—especially in early conceptual phases.

- **Cognitive implications of AI-provided external representations:** The impact of AI-generated sketches, 3D worlds, or complex data visualizations on designers’ mental models and problem restructuring remains under-explored.

- **Balancing exploration and fixation in human–AI co-creation:** How do designers avoid overfitting to AI suggestions? What strategies foster productive divergence? Understanding these mechanisms could prevent premature convergence or creativity stagnation.

- **Material and embodied cognition with AI in physical design:** Research is emerging on AI's role in negotiating material constraints, but more focus on the tacit, sensory, and embodied dimensions of design cognition with AI assistance is needed.

- **Ethical cognition and collective agency:** How do designers integrate ethical reflection and social responsibility as intrinsic elements of their cognitive workflow when partnering with AI? This is especially critical as AI mediates design outcomes impacting diverse user groups.

- **Methodology bridging controlled studies with authentic practice:** Further development of methods that capture the richness of reflective practice, including longitudinal diary studies and ethnographies of human-AI interaction in real-world design studios, offer rich opportunities to deepen understanding.
